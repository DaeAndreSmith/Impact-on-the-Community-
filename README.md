# My soultion to the problem

###### To solve this problem I came up with the idea that the city could remodel or destory and build new property to get rid of the eye sore.
###### This will allow new people and/or businesses to move in and make money for the city.  
###### First the city will need to know where the bandon property is located.
###### Next they will need to see the condition of the property so that they can determine if the property can be remodeled or destroyed to make a new building in the same area. 
###### Finally they will need to promote the new property to help influence people and/or businesses to buy the property.
###### This will increase Jackson's profits and the city will then benefit from the increase in revenue and taxes, and these funds can then be used to improve the roads and do other much needed renovations.
